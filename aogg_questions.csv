"14","1",14,"Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going there?  "
"45","1",45,"Yet what of Matthew’s white collar and the sorrel mare? "
"48","1",48,"“This is a real fine evening, isn’t it? "
"49","1",49,"Won’t you sit down? "
"50","1",50,"How are all your folks?”  "
"65","1",65,"“Are you in earnest, Marilla?” "
"76","1",76,"“What on earth put such a notion into your head?” "
"182","1",182,"“I suppose you are Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?” "
"187","1",187,"I wouldn’t be a bit afraid, and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine, don’t you think? "
"188","1",188,"You could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls, couldn’t you? "
"203","1",203,"We’ve got to drive a long piece, haven’t we? "
"213","1",213,"It’s so easy to be wicked without knowing it, isn’t it? "
"218","1",218,"I guess that’s why I’m so thin--I _am_ dreadful thin, ain’t I? "
"224","1",224,"“Isn’t that beautiful? "
"225","1",225,"What did that tree, leaning out from the bank, all white and lacy, make you think of?” "
"236","1",236,"And I’ve never had a pretty dress in my life that I can remember--but of course it’s all the more to look forward to, isn’t it? "
"241","1",241,"Some people said it was because he couldn’t sell it, but I’d rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart, wouldn’t you? "
"249","1",249,"But if it kept her from being seasick it’s a mercy I did prowl, isn’t it? "
"255","1",255,"It’s delightful when your imaginations come true, isn’t it? "
"259","1",259,"I suppose I had, too, but how you going to find out about things if you don’t ask questions? "
"260","1",260,"And what _does_ make the roads red?”  "
"263","1",263,"Isn’t it splendid to think of all the things there are to find out about? "
"265","1",265,"It wouldn’t be half so interesting if we know all about everything, would it? "
"266","1",266,"There’d be no scope for imagination then, would there? "
"267","1",267,"But am I talking too much? "
"269","1",269,"Would you rather I didn’t talk? "
"286","1",286,"But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them, haven’t you?”  "
"299","1",299,"If you were out in a great big woods with other trees all around you and little mosses and June bells growing over your roots and a brook not far away and birds singing in you branches, you could grow, couldn’t you? "
"303","1",303,"You do get so attached to things like that, don’t you? "
"304","1",304,"Is there a brook anywhere near Green Gables? "
"310","1",310,"Dreams don’t often come true, do they? "
"311","1",311,"Wouldn’t it be nice if they did? "
"313","1",313,"I can’t feel exactly perfectly happy because--well, what color would you call this?”  "
"316","1",316,"“It’s red, ain’t it?” "
"332","1",332,"What is an alabaster brow? "
"334","1",334,"Can you tell me?”  "
"338","1",338,"Have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be divinely beautiful?”  "
"341","1",341,"Which would you rather be if you had the choice--divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?”  "
"364","1",364,"“Oh, Mr. Cuthbert,” she whispered, “that place we came through--that white place--what was it?”  "
"367","1",367,"“Pretty? "
"374","1",374,"Did you ever have an ache like that, Mr. Cuthbert?”  "
"380","1",380,"Isn’t that a nice imaginative name? "
"384","1",384,"Have we really only another mile to go before we get home? "
"407","1",407,"Do things ever give you a thrill?”  "
"413","1",413,"Do you think it can? "
"414","1",414,"There doesn’t seem to be much connection between grubs and lakes of shining waters, does there? "
"415","1",415,"But why do other people call it Barry’s pond?”  "
"420","1",420,"“Has Mr. Barry any little girls? "
"441","1",441,"Isn’t it splendid there are so many things to like in this world? "
"460","1",460,"“That’s it, isn’t it?” "
"488","1",488,"“Matthew Cuthbert, who’s that?” "
"490","1",490,"“Where is the boy?”  "
"514","1",514,"Oh, what shall I do? "
"530","1",530,"What’s your name?”  "
"532","1",532,"“Will you please call me Cordelia?” "
"534","1",534,"“_Call_ you Cordelia? "
"535","1",535,"Is that your name?”  "
"539","1",539,"If Cordelia isn’t your name, what is?”  "
"541","1",541,"It can’t matter much to you what you call me if I’m only going to be here a little while, can it? "
"551","1",551,"“What difference does it make how it’s spelled?” "
"555","1",555,"When you hear a name pronounced can’t you always see it in your mind, just as if it was printed out? "
"558","1",558,"“Very well, then, Anne spelled with an E, can you tell us how this mistake came to be made? "
"560","1",560,"Were there no boys at the asylum?”  "
"566","1",566,"Oh,” she added reproachfully, turning to Matthew, “why didn’t you tell me at the station that you didn’t want me and leave me there? "
"568","1",568,"“What on earth does she mean?” "
"573","1",573,"“Did Mrs. Spencer bring anybody over besides you?” "
"577","1",577,"If I was very beautiful and had nut-brown hair would you keep me?”  "
"592","1",592,"Can you eat when you are in the depths of despair?”  "
"594","1",594,"“Weren’t you? "
"595","1",595,"Well, did you ever try to _imagine_ you were in the depths of despair?”  "
"613","1",613,"“I suppose you have a nightgown?” "
"639","1",639,"“How can you call it a _good_ night when you know it must be the very worst night I’ve ever had?” "
"652","1",652,"Don’t you know it?”  "
"660","1",660,"What good would she be to us?”  "
"690","1",690,"Oh, wasn’t it beautiful? "
"691","1",691,"Wasn’t it a lovely place? "
"708","1",708,"“Oh, isn’t it wonderful?” "
"712","1",712,"Don’t you feel as if you just loved the world on a morning like this? "
"714","1",714,"Have you ever noticed what cheerful things brooks are? "
"723","1",723,"Isn’t it a splendid thing that there are mornings? "
"739","1",739,"All sorts of mornings are interesting, don’t you think? "
"743","1",743,"It’s all very well to read about sorrows and imagine yourself living through them heroically, but it’s not so nice when you really come to have them, is it?”  "
"750","1",750,"Who would want such a child about the place?  "
"755","1",755,"“Can you wash dishes right?” "
"780","1",780,"“What’s the matter now?” "
"788","1",788,"There is no use in loving things if you have to be torn from them, is there? "
"789","1",789,"And it’s so hard to keep from loving things, isn’t it? "
"794","1",794,"What is the name of that geranium on the window-sill, please?”  "
"798","1",798,"Didn’t you give it a name? "
"799","1",799,"May I give it one then? "
"800","1",800,"May I call it--let me see--Bonny would do--may I call it Bonny while I’m here? "
"803","1",803,"But where on earth is the sense of naming a geranium?”  "
"806","1",806,"How do you know but that it hurts a geranium’s feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else? "
"811","1",811,"Of course, it won’t always be in blossom, but one can imagine that it is, can’t one?”  "
"820","1",820,"But what’s to be done with a man who just _looks?"
"823","1",823,"“I suppose I can have the mare and buggy this afternoon, Matthew?” "
"841","1",841,"Isn’t it lovely? "
"842","1",842,"Don’t you think it must be glad to be a rose? "
"843","1",843,"Wouldn’t it be nice if roses could talk? "
"845","1",845,"And isn’t pink the most bewitching color in the world? "
"848","1",848,"Did you ever know of anybody whose hair was red when she was young, but got to be another color when she grew up?”  "
"856","1",856,"I am so fond of romantic things, and a graveyard full of buried hopes is about as romantic a thing as one can imagine isn’t it? "
"858","1",858,"Are we going across the Lake of Shining Waters today?”  "
"862","1",862,"“Is it as nice as it sounds? "
"867","1",867,"How far is it to White Sands?”  "
"874","1",874,"Where were you born and how old are you?”  "
"879","1",879,"Aren’t Walter and Bertha lovely names? "
"881","1",881,"It would be a real disgrace to have a father named--well, say Jedediah, wouldn’t it?”  "
"898","1",898,"I should think a mother would be a better judge than a poor woman who came in to scrub, wouldn’t you? "
"902","1",902,"I think it would be so sweet to say ‘mother,’ don’t you? "
"910","1",910,"Do you know if there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make people who are brought up that way better than other people? "
"931","1",931,"“Did you ever go to school?” "
"938","1",938,"Don’t you just love poetry that gives you a crinkly feeling up and down your back? "
"942","1",942,"Thomas and Mrs. Hammond--good to you?” "
"949","1",949,"It’s  a very trying to have a drunken husband, you see; and it must be very trying to have twins three times in succession, don’t you think? "
"957","1",957,"What if she, Marilla, should indulge Matthew’s unaccountable whim and let her stay? "
"967","1",967,"“Isn’t the sea wonderful?” "
"973","1",973,"Aren’t those gulls splendid? "
"974","1",974,"Would you like to be a gull? "
"976","1",976,"Don’t you think it would be nice to wake up at sunrise and swoop down over the water and away out over that lovely blue all day; and then at night to fly back to one’s nest? "
"978","1",978,"What big house is that just ahead, please?”  "
"990","1",990,"You’ll put your horse in? "
"991","1",991,"And how are you, Anne?”  "
"1000","1",1000,"“Why, Robert sent word down by his daughter Nancy and she said you wanted a girl--didn’t she Flora Jane?” "
"1011","1",1011,"Can we send the child back to the asylum? "
"1012","1",1012,"I suppose they’ll take her back, won’t they?”  "
"1040","1",1040,"Was she to be given into the keeping of this sharp-faced, sharp-eyed woman? "
"1049","1",1049,"“How old are you and what’s your name?” "
"1074","1",1074,"Will that suit you, Mrs. Blewett?”  "
"1079","1",1079,"“Oh, Miss Cuthbert, did you really say that perhaps you would let me stay at Green Gables?” "
"1081","1",1081,"“Did you really say it? "
"1082","1",1082,"Or did I only imagine that you did?”  "
"1121","1",1121,"Did you ever suppose you’d see the day when you’d be adopting an orphan girl? "
"1138","1",1138,"“Why, Anne, what do you mean? "
"1139","1",1139,"Were you never taught to say your prayers? "
"1141","1",1141,"Don’t you know who God is, Anne?”  "
"1146","1",1146,"Where did you learn that?”  "
"1152","1",1152,"Isn’t that grand? "
"1154","1",1154,"You couldn’t quite call it poetry, I suppose, but it sounds a lot like it, doesn’t it?”  "
"1156","1",1156,"Don’t you know it’s a terrible wicked thing not to say your prayers every night? "
"1163","1",1163,"Now, do you honestly think they can?”  "
"1174","1",1174,"“Why must people kneel down to pray? "
"1179","1",1179,"What am I to say?”  "
"1186","1",1186,"“Gracious heavenly Father--that’s the way the ministers say it in church, so I suppose it’s all right in private prayer, isn’t it?” "
"1194","1",1194,"“There, did I do all right?” "
"1200","1",1200,"I should have said, ‘Amen’ in place of ‘yours respectfully,’ shouldn’t I?--the way the ministers do. "
"1202","1",1202,"Do you suppose it will make any difference?”  "
"1210","1",1210,"Will you believe that she never said a prayer in her life till tonight? "
"1221","1",1221,"Her thin little body trembled from head to foot; her face flushed and her eyes dilated until they were almost black; she clasped her hands tightly and said in an imploring voice:  “Oh, please, Miss Cuthbert, won’t you tell me if you are going to send me away or not? "
"1231","1",1231,"Why, child, whatever is the matter?”  "
"1242","1",1242,"But can you tell me why I’m crying?”  "
"1248","1",1248,"“What am I to call you?” "
"1250","1",1250,"“Shall I always say Miss Cuthbert? "
"1251","1",1251,"Can I call you Aunt Marilla?”  "
"1261","1",1261,"Can’t I call you Aunt Marilla?”  "
"1266","1",1266,"“Do you never imagine things different from what they really are?” "
"1279","1",1279,"You couldn’t really expect a person to pray very well the first time she tried, could you? "
"1282","1",1282,"But would you believe it? "
"1286","1",1286,"Have you ever noticed that?”  "
"1293","1",1293,"“Anne, whatever are you thinking of?” "
"1297","1",1297,"She looks lonely and sad, don’t you think? "
"1303","1",1303,"But it’s likely He did, don’t you think? "
"1331","1",1331,"“Marilla,” she demanded presently, “do you think that I shall ever have a bosom friend in Avonlea?”  "
"1332","1",1332,"“A--a what kind of friend?”  "
"1336","1",1336,"Do you think it’s possible?”  "
"1344","1",1344,"“What is Diana like? "
"1345","1",1345,"Her hair isn’t red, is it? "
"1393","1",1393,"“Can I take the apple blossoms with me for company?” "
"1400","1",1400,"What do you do when you meet with an irresistible temptation?”  "
"1401","1",1401,"“Anne, did you hear me tell you to go to your room?”  "
"1419","1",1419,"But it’s a million times nicer to be Anne of Green Gables than Anne of nowhere in particular, isn’t it?”  "
"1450","1",1450,"“Couldn’t you have sent her back?”  "
"1470","1",1470,"Lawful heart, did any one ever see such freckles? "
"1477","1",1477,"“How dare you call me skinny and ugly? "
"1478","1",1478,"How dare you say I’m freckled and redheaded? "
"1483","1",1483,"“How dare you say such things about me?” "
"1485","1",1485,"“How would you like to have such things said about you? "
"1486","1",1486,"How would you like to be told that you are fat and clumsy and probably hadn’t a spark of imagination in you? "
"1502","1",1502,"“Marilla Cuthbert, you don’t mean to say that you are upholding her in such a terrible display of temper as we’ve just seen?” "
"1527","1",1527,"And how was she to punish her? "
"1538","1",1538,"Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?”  "
"1569","1",1569,"How can I? "
"1573","1",1573,"I can’t say I’m sorry when I’m not, can I? "
"1590","1",1590,"You’re--you’re going to give her something to eat, aren’t you?”  "
"1591","1",1591,"“When did you ever hear of me starving people into good behavior?”  "
"1598","1",1598,"Had Anne eaten anything at all?  "
"1606","1",1606,"“Anne,” he whispered, as if afraid of being overheard, “how are you making it, Anne?”  "
"1614","1",1614,"“Well now, Anne, don’t you think you’d better do it and have it over with?” "
"1618","1",1618,"“Do you mean apologize to Mrs. Lynde?”  "
"1642","1",1642,"“How would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow?”  "
"1646","1",1646,"“Well?” "
"1658","1",1658,"“What are you thinking of, Anne?” "
"1678","1",1678,"If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow on a poor little orphan girl, would you, even if she had a dreadful temper? "
"1685","1",1685,"Where was the wholesome punishment upon which she, Marilla, had plumed herself? "
"1701","1",1701,"It would be so much easier to be good if one’s hair was a handsome auburn, don’t you think? "
"1702","1",1702,"And now may I go out into your garden and sit on that bench under the apple-trees while you and Marilla are talking? "
"1717","1",1717,"“I apologized pretty well, didn’t I?” "
"1727","1",1727,"Do you suppose my hair will really be a handsome auburn when I grow up?”  "
"1730","1",1730,"“How can I be vain when I know I’m homely?” "
"1740","1",1740,"It gives you a lovely, comfortable feeling to apologize and be forgiven, doesn’t it? "
"1741","1",1741,"Aren’t the stars bright tonight? "
"1742","1",1742,"If you could live in a star, which one would you pick? "
"1766","1",1766,"Anne’s Impressions of Sunday-School   |WELL, how do you like them?” "
"1774","1",1774,"What is the matter with them? "
"1775","1",1775,"Aren’t they neat and clean and new?”  "
"1777","1",1777,"“Then why don’t you like them?”  "
"1830","1",1830,"“Well, how did you like Sunday school?” "
"1860","1",1860,"Why couldn’t I? "
"1897","1",1897,"What on earth put you up to such a caper? "
"1906","1",1906,"What’s the difference?”  "
"1950","1",1950,"“How do you do, Marilla?” "
"1953","1",1953,"And this is the little girl you have adopted, I suppose?”  "
"1956","1",1956,"Mrs. Barry, not hearing or not comprehending, merely shook hands and said kindly:  “How are you?”  "
"1958","1",1958,"Then aside to Marilla in an audible whisper, “There wasn’t anything startling in that, was there, Marilla?”  "
"1972","1",1972,"“Oh, Diana,” said Anne at last, clasping her hands and speaking almost in a whisper, “oh, do you think you can like me a little--enough to be my bosom friend?”  "
"1979","1",1979,"“Will you swear to be my friend forever and ever?” "
"1990","1",1990,"“How do you do it?”  "
"2004","1",2004,"“Well, did you find Diana a kindred spirit?” "
"2010","1",2010,"Can I have those broken pieces of china that are out in the woodshed? "
"2012","1",2012,"Don’t you think that is a very strange coincidence? "
"2016","1",2016,"Don’t you think Diana has got very soulful eyes? "
"2025","1",2025,"Isn’t that a perfectly elegant name? "
"2044","1",2044,"And I can give Diana half of them, can’t I? "
"2064","1",2064,"_ And, oh, Marilla, can I go to it?”  "
"2066","1",2066,"What time did I tell you to come in?”  "
"2067","1",2067,"“Two o’clock--but isn’t it splendid about the picnic, Marilla? "
"2068","1",2068,"Please can I go? "
"2076","1",2076,"Please can I go?”  "
"2111","1",2111,"Isn’t that a poetical name? "
"2117","1",2117,"You must come and see it, Marilla--won’t you? "
"2132","1",2132,"I’d be satisfied with one, wouldn’t you? "
"2135","1",2135,"I’d love to be able to faint, wouldn’t you, Marilla? "
"2139","1",2139,"Don’t you think I am? "
"2183","1",2183,"Will you let me hold the brooch for one minute, Marilla? "
"2184","1",2184,"Do you think amethysts can be the souls of good violets?”     "
"2187","1",2187,"“Anne,” she said to that small personage, who was shelling peas by the spotless table and singing, “Nelly of the Hazel Dell” with a vigor and expression that did credit to Diana’s teaching, “did you see anything of my amethyst brooch? "
"2191","1",2191,"“Did you touch it?” "
"2197","1",2197,"Where did you put it?”  "
"2217","1",2217,"Now, what have you done with it? "
"2219","1",2219,"Did you take it out and lose it?”  "
"2228","1",2228,"“Will I take the peas with me?” "
"2234","1",2234,"What if Anne had lost it? "
"2254","1",2254,"“You’re sure it hasn’t fell down behind the bureau?” "
"2259","1",2259,"“Well now, what are you going to do about it?” "
"2278","1",2278,"“You won’t keep me from going to that, will you? "
"2279","1",2279,"You’ll just let me out for the afternoon, won’t you? "
"2301","1",2301,"Diana and I make necklaces of roseberries but what are roseberries compared to amethysts? "
"2359","1",2359,"Don’t you think it’s pretty rough not to let her go to the picnic when she’s so set on it?”  "
"2378","1",2378,"“Dear life and heart,” said Marilla blankly, “what does this mean? "
"2380","1",2380,"Whatever did that girl mean by saying she took it and lost it? "
"2403","1",2403,"“Oh, Marilla, isn’t it too late?”  "
"2416","1",2416,"Isn’t it very expressive? "
"2437","1",2437,"“Isn’t it good just to be alive on a day like this? "
"2440","1",2440,"And it’s splendider still to have such a lovely way to go to school by, isn’t it?”  "
"2452","1",2452,"And it’s a very pretty name, don’t you think? "
"2461","1",2461,"Oh, Marilla, can’t you just imagine you see them? "
"2465","1",2465,"It’s nice to be clever at something, isn’t it? "
"2480","1",2480,"How would she get on with the other children? "
"2481","1",2481,"And how on earth would she ever manage to hold her tongue during school hours?  "
"2514","1",2514,"Ruby Gillis gave me an apple and Sophia Sloane lent me a lovely pink card with ‘May I see you home?’ "
"2518","1",2518,"Can I have some of those pearl beads off the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring? "
"2521","1",2521,"Marilla, have I really a pretty nose? "
"2533","1",2533,"“Gilbert Blythe?” "
"2535","1",2535,"“Isn’t his name that’s written up on the porch wall with Julia Bell’s and a big ‘Take Notice’ over them?”  "
"2570","1",2570,"Did you ever? "
"2606","1",2606,"“Anne Shirley, what does this mean?” "
"2634","1",2634,"“Oh how could you, Anne?” "
"2665","1",2665,"“Did you hear what I said, Anne?” "
"2684","1",2684,"“What are you taking all those things home for, Anne?” "
"2689","1",2689,"“Will Marilla let you stay home?” "
"2696","1",2696,"What shall I do? "
"2713","1",2713,"“Don’t you understand, Marilla? "
"2743","1",2743,"What would you advise, Rachel?”  "
"2774","1",2774,"“Whatever’s the matter now, Anne?” "
"2780","1",2780,"And oh, what shall I do? "
"2785","1",2785,"When had he heard Marilla laugh like that before?  "
"2792","1",2792,"It would be terrible if we just skipped from September to November, wouldn’t it? "
"2794","1",2794,"Don’t they give you a thrill--several thrills? "
"2821","1",2821,"Oh, Marilla, can I use the rosebud spray tea set?”  "
"2824","1",2824,"Well, what next? "
"2835","1",2835,"Can I take her into the spare room to lay off her hat when she comes? "
"2836","1",2836,"And then into the parlor to sit?”  "
"2846","1",2846,"“How is your mother?” "
"2849","1",2849,"I suppose Mr. Cuthbert is hauling potatoes to the _lily sands_ this afternoon, is he?” "
"2855","1",2855,"Have you picked many of your apples yet?”  "
"2863","1",2863,"I love bright red drinks, don’t you? "
"2883","1",2883,"There are so many responsibilities on a person’s mind when they’re keeping house, isn’t there?”  "
"2928","1",2928,"Why, Diana, what is the matter?”  "
"2938","1",2938,"Where do you feel bad?”  "
"2942","1",2942,"“Oh, Diana, do you suppose that it’s possible you’re really taking the smallpox? "
"2946","1",2946,"Where do you feel bad?”  "
"2955","1",2955,"“Whatever has gone wrong now, Anne?” "
"2969","1",2969,"“Anne are you or Mrs. Barry crazy? "
"2970","1",2970,"What on earth did you give her?”  "
"2983","1",2983,"Didn’t you know the difference yourself?”  "
"3019","1",3019,"“Mrs. Barry won’t forgive me?”  "
"3032","1",3032,"“What do you want?” "
"3037","1",3037,"How could I? "
"3039","1",3039,"Do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose? "
"3049","1",3049,"“Won’t you let me see Diana just once to say farewell?” "
"3066","1",3066,"“Your mother hasn’t relented?” "
"3074","1",3074,"“Oh, Diana, will you promise faithfully never to forget me, the friend of your youth, no matter what dearer friends may caress thee?”  "
"3077","1",3077,"“Oh, Diana,” cried Anne, clasping her hands, “do you _love_ me?”  "
"3079","1",3079,"Didn’t you know that?”  "
"3091","1",3091,"Diana, wilt thou give me a lock of thy jet-black tresses in parting to treasure forevermore?”  "
"3092","1",3092,"“Have you got anything to cut it with?” "
"3189","1",3189,"But really, Marilla, one can’t stay sad very long in such an interesting world, can one?”    "
"3206","1",3206,"“Matthew, did you ever study geometry when you went to school?”  "
"3220","1",3220,"I don’t think a teacher should take such a mean advantage, do you? "
"3226","1",3226,"What way do you vote, Matthew?”  "
"3232","1",3232,"Is that true, Matthew?”  "
"3234","1",3234,"“Did you ever go courting, Matthew?”  "
"3237","1",3237,"“It must be rather interesting, don’t you think, Matthew? "
"3254","1",3254,"And then shall I run down the cellar and get some russets, Matthew? "
"3255","1",3255,"Wouldn’t you like some russets?”  "
"3259","1",3259,"“Whatever is the matter, Diana?” "
"3261","1",3261,"“Has your mother relented at last?”  "
"3316","1",3316,"“Oh, Matthew, isn’t it a wonderful morning? "
"3317","1",3317,"The world looks like something God had just imagined for His own pleasure, doesn’t it? "
"3319","1",3319,"I’m so glad I live in a world where there are white frosts, aren’t you? "
"3326","1",3326,"But I hate to stay home, for Gil--some of the others will get head of the class, and it’s so hard to get up again--although of course the harder it is the more satisfaction you have when you do get up, haven’t you?”  "
"3331","1",3331,"“Oh, did you see the Premier?” "
"3333","1",3333,"“What did he look like Marilla?”  "
"3354","1",3354,"“Oh, Marilla, can I go right now--without washing my dishes? "
"3357","1",3357,"“Anne Shirley--are you crazy? "
"3372","1",3372,"That was a pretty dignified way of speaking wasn’t it, Marilla?”  "
"3385","1",3385,"And Mrs. Barry asked me if I took tea and said ‘Pa, why don’t you pass the biscuits to Anne?’ "
"3397","1",3397,"A Concert a Catastrophe and a Confession   |MARILLA, can I go over to see Diana just for a minute?” "
"3404","1",3404,"“How do you know she has?”  "
"3414","1",3414,"Two flashes mean, ‘Are you there?’ "
"3422","1",3422,"“Oh, Marilla, what do you think? "
"3427","1",3427,"You will, won’t you, Marilla? "
"3444","1",3444,"Please, mayn’t I go, Marilla?”  "
"3445","1",3445,"“You heard what I said, Anne, didn’t you? "
"3455","1",3455,"“Who’s bringing this child up, Matthew, you or me?”  "
"3507","1",3507,"“Oh, Diana,” breathed Anne, squeezing Diana’s mittened hand under the fur robe, “isn’t it all like a beautiful dream? "
"3508","1",3508,"Do I really look the same as usual? "
"3522","1",3522,"“Hasn’t it been a delightful time?” "
"3525","1",3525,"Do you suppose we will ever be asked to do it, Diana?”  "
"3529","1",3529,"Oh, Anne, how could you pretend not to listen to him? "
"3532","1",3532,"Are you ready for bed? "
"3539","1",3539,"“Oh, who was it--_what_ was it?” "
"3544","1",3544,"It’s dreadful--it’s really dreadful--but did you ever know anything so funny, Anne?”  "
"3545","1",3545,"“Who is your Aunt Josephine?”  "
"3553","1",3553,"“Did you have a good time last night? "
"3558","1",3558,"“So you and Diana nearly frightened poor old Miss Barry to death last night?” "
"3580","1",3580,"Can you tell me why it is so, Mrs. Lynde?”  "
"3586","1",3586,"Haven’t you never felt that yourself, Mrs. Lynde?”  "
"3595","1",3595,"“Your Aunt Josephine was very cross about it, wasn’t she?” "
"3603","1",3603,"“Why didn’t you tell them it was my fault?” "
"3605","1",3605,"“It’s likely I’d do such a thing, isn’t it?” "
"3625","1",3625,"“Who are you?” "
"3628","1",3628,"“Confess what?”  "
"3634","1",3634,"“Oh, I must, hey? "
"3650","1",3650,"Have you any imagination, Miss Barry? "
"3691","1",3691,"“Diana says perhaps they have something better, but there couldn’t be anything better than Mayflowers, could there, Marilla? "
"3695","1",3695,"Do you know what I think Mayflowers are, Marilla? "
"3752","1",3752,"Do you remember what happened this day last year, Marilla?”  "
"3760","1",3760,"Are you sorry you kept me, Marilla?”  "
"3764","1",3764,"“Too dark? "
"3769","1",3769,"“What has got into your head now, Anne Shirley? "
"3778","1",3778,"Are you crazy? "
"3779","1",3779,"What under the canopy is the Haunted Wood?”  "
"3783","1",3783,"Who has been telling you such stuff?”  "
"3801","1",3801,"“Anne Shirley, do you mean to tell me you believe all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination?”  "
"3824","1",3824,"“Oh, Marilla, how can you be so cruel?” "
"3826","1",3826,"“What would you feel like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off?”  "
"3844","1",3844,"“Well, so nothing caught you?” "
"3849","1",3849,"“Wasn’t it fortunate, Marilla, that I took an extra handkerchief to school today? "
"3871","1",3871,"But one can’t feel quite in the depths of despair with two months’ vacation before them, can they, Marilla? "
"3873","1",3873,"For all I was feeling so bad about Mr. Phillips going away I couldn’t help taking a little interest in a new minister, could I? "
"3879","1",3879,"Besides, she’s only been a minister’s wife for a little while, so one should make allowances, shouldn’t they? "
"3893","1",3893,"Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man, but he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church; he was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister, mustn’t you, Matthew? "
"3895","1",3895,"Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing woman, isn’t she, Matthew? "
"3936","1",3936,"“But oh, Marilla, will you let me make a cake for the occasion? "
"3960","1",3960,"Do you suppose the dryad will come out after we go away and take it for a scarf?”  "
"3974","1",3974,"But do you think it will rise? "
"3975","1",3975,"Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isn’t good? "
"3979","1",3979,"Marilla, what if that cake doesn’t rise?”  "
"3984","1",3984,"“Can I fix the table with ferns and wild roses?”  "
"4005","1",4005,"she exclaimed, “what on earth did you put into that cake?”  "
"4007","1",4007,"“Oh, isn’t it all right?”  "
"4012","1",4012,"What flavoring did you use?”  "
"4022","1",4022,"I suppose it’s partly my fault--I should have warned you--but for pity’s sake why couldn’t you have smelled it?”  "
"4039","1",4039,"Won’t you tell Mrs. Allan so, Marilla?”  "
"4054","1",4054,"“Marilla, isn’t it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet?”  "
"4058","1",4058,"“But have you ever noticed one encouraging thing about me, Marilla? "
"4061","1",4061,"“Oh, don’t you see, Marilla? "
"4068","1",4068,"Now?” "
"4070","1",4070,"“Have you discovered another kindred spirit?” "
"4073","1",4073,"“No, Marilla, but oh, what do you think? "
"4100","1",4100,"Wouldn’t it be nice if it could last? "
"4104","1",4104,"What if I shouldn’t behave properly? "
"4107","1",4107,"Would it be good manners to take a second helping of anything if you wanted to _very_ much?”  "
"4129","1",4129,"But don’t you think the trying so hard ought to count for something? "
"4149","1",4149,"And would you believe it, Marilla? "
"4152","1",4152,"Mrs. Lynde came to the manse just before I left, and what do you think, Marilla? "
"4155","1",4155,"Isn’t that a romantic name? "
"4183","1",4183,"“Couldn’t I?” "
"4205","1",4205,"“Anne, are you killed?” "
"4209","1",4209,"“Where?” "
"4211","1",4211,"“Oh, where, Anne?” "
"4214","1",4214,"“What’s the matter? "
"4215","1",4215,"Where have you hurt yourself?” "
"4227","1",4227,"“Mr. Barry, what has happened to her?” "
"4244","1",4244,"“Aren’t you very sorry for me, Marilla?”  "
"4248","1",4248,"But what would you have done, Marilla, if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole?”  "
"4268","1",4268,"“Isn’t it fortunate I’ve got such an imagination?” "
"4271","1",4271,"What do people who haven’t any imagination do when they break their bones, do you suppose, Marilla?”  "
"4290","1",4290,"Isn’t that something to be proud of, Marilla? "
"4344","1",4344,"How can I be, when I’m such a dunce at geometry? "
"4351","1",4351,"Mustn’t it be splendid to be remarkable and have compositions written about you after you’re dead? "
"4373","1",4373,"“Well, when you can combine patriotism and fun, isn’t it all right? "
"4388","1",4388,"That would have been ridiculous, for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as Josie? "
"4394","1",4394,"You couldn’t imagine a fairy wearing boots, could you? "
"4395","1",4395,"Especially with copper toes? "
"4398","1",4398,"Oh, Marilla, I know you are not so enthusiastic about it as I am, but don’t you hope your little Anne will distinguish herself?”  "
"4420","1",4420,"Then in what did it consist?  "
"4451","1",4451,"“What can I do for you this evening, Mr. Cuthbert?” "
"4453","1",4453,"“Have you any--any--any--well now, say any garden rakes?” "
"4459","1",4459,"When Miss Harris returned with the rake and cheerfully inquired: “Anything else tonight, Mr. Cuthbert?” "
"4469","1",4469,"“White or brown?” "
"4480","1",4480,"“Whatever possessed you to get so much? "
"4490","1",4490,"“Pick out a dress for you to give Anne? "
"4493","1",4493,"Have you something particular in mind? "
"4494","1",4494,"No? "
"4497","1",4497,"Perhaps you’d like me to make it up for her, too, seeing that if Marilla was to make it Anne would probably get wind of it before the time and spoil the surprise? "
"4504","1",4504,"“Puffs? "
"4521","1",4521,"“So this is what Matthew has been looking so mysterious over and grinning about to himself for two weeks, is it?” "
"4538","1",4538,"Isn’t it a lovely Christmas? "
"4540","1",4540,"Any other kind of Christmas doesn’t seem real, does it? "
"4543","1",4543,"What makes people call them green? "
"4544","1",4544,"Why--why--Matthew, is that for me? "
"4552","1",4552,"“Why--why--Anne, don’t you like it? "
"4597","1",4597,"Did you ever hear anything equal to that?”  "
"4601","1",4601,"“Oh, hasn’t it been a brilliant evening?” "
"4606","1",4606,"“Oh, Diana, will we really see our names in print? "
"4621","1",4621,"Did I groan all right?”  "
"4625","1",4625,"It’s so romantic to take part in a concert, isn’t it? "
"4627","1",4627,"“Wasn’t the boys’ dialogue fine?” "
"4659","1",4659,"Could she go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway days before the concert? "
"4693","1",4693,"Mrs. Allan says we should never make uncharitable speeches; but they do slip out so often before you think, don’t they? "
"4720","1",4720,"“It’s easy for you because you have an imagination,” retorted Diana, “but what would you do if you had been born without one? "
"4721","1",4721,"I suppose you have your composition all done?”  "
"4740","1",4740,"“Well, what became of Cordelia and Geraldine?” "
"4748","1",4748,"She said Malcolm told Susan that his dad had given him the farm in his own name and then said, ‘What do you say, darling pet, if we get hitched this fall?’ "
"4818","1",4818,"Do you think there is any prospect of it, Marilla?”  "
"4824","1",4824,"Is it very wicked of me, Marilla, to feel encouraged when I hear that other people have been bad and mischievous? "
"4869","1",4869,"“Mercy on us,” said astonished Marilla, “have you been asleep, Anne?”  "
"4871","1",4871,"“Are you sick then?” "
"4880","1",4880,"“Did anyone ever hear the like?” "
"4882","1",4882,"“Anne Shirley, whatever is the matter with you? "
"4883","1",4883,"What have you done? "
"4886","1",4886,"There now, what is it?”  "
"4891","1",4891,"“Anne Shirley, what have you done to your hair? "
"4903","1",4903,"Now, then, what did you do to your hair?”  "
"4907","1",4907,"Anne Shirley, didn’t you know it was a wicked thing to do?”  "
"4917","1",4917,"How could I doubt his word, Marilla? "
"4922","1",4922,"“Who said? "
"4923","1",4923,"Who are you talking about?”  "
"4947","1",4947,"“Oh, Marilla, what shall I do?” "
"4971","1",4971,"But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you’ve dyed it a dreadful color, is there? "
"4991","1",4991,"It makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people, doesn’t it? "
"4999","1",4999,"But am I talking too much, Marilla? "
"5000","1",5000,"Does it hurt your head?”  "
"5025","1",5025,"“Oh, do you really think so?” "
"5028","1",5028,"Do you think it could be called auburn now, Diana?”  "
"5052","1",5052,"Do you suppose it’s really right to act like this? "
"5076","1",5076,"Where were the oars? "
"5097","1",5097,"Why didn’t somebody come? "
"5098","1",5098,"Where had the girls gone? "
"5107","1",5107,"How on earth did you get there?” "
"5112","1",5112,"“What has happened, Anne?” "
"5117","1",5117,"Will you be kind enough to row me to the landing?”  "
"5122","1",5122,"Can’t we be good friends? "
"5153","1",5153,"And Ruby is in hysterics--oh, Anne, how did you escape?”  "
"5168","1",5168,"“Will you ever have any sense, Anne?” "
"5197","1",5197,"“Isn’t this evening just like a purple dream, Diana? "
"5208","1",5208,"“Jane’s mother is going to let her have a birthday party?”  "
"5211","1",5211,"Did he?”  "
"5217","1",5217,"“Oh, Diana,” whispered Anne, finding it necessary to lean up against a maple tree for support, “do you really mean it? "
"5248","1",5248,"Do you suppose it’s wrong for us to think so much about our clothes? "
"5250","1",5250,"But it is such an interesting subject, isn’t it?”  "
"5276","1",5276,"“Isn’t it just like a palace?” "
"5294","1",5294,"And I was glad that I felt glad, for it shows I’m improving, don’t you think, Marilla, when I can rejoice in Josie’s success? "
"5297","1",5297,"Do you? "
"5300","1",5300,"So Avonlea was pretty well represented, wasn’t it? "
"5354","1",5354,"“And you, Anne-girl?”  "
"5375","1",5375,"“So you’ve got back?” "
"5406","1",5406,"“Was she? "
"5408","1",5408,"Why didn’t you call me, Marilla? "
"5420","1",5420,"Young men are all very well in their place, but it doesn’t do to drag them into everything, does it? "
"5434","1",5434,"But why was Miss Stacy here this afternoon?”  "
"5437","1",5437,"“About me?” "
"5461","1",5461,"“Oh, how can you call Ben Hur a novel when it’s really such a religious book?” "
"5483","1",5483,"What do you think about it yourself, Anne? "
"5484","1",5484,"Would you like to go to Queen’s and pass for a teacher?”  "
"5490","1",5490,"But won’t it be dreadfully expensive? "
"5512","1",5512,"I would call it a worthy purpose to want to be a teacher like Miss Stacy, wouldn’t you, Marilla? "
"5539","1",5539,"“What is Gilbert Blythe going to be?” "
"5568","1",5568,"“Are you going to be back next year, Miss Stacy?” "
"5606","1",5606,"You’ll stay to tea?”  "
"5639","1",5639,"Doesn’t Mr. Allan preach magnificent sermons? "
"5641","1",5641,"But I don’t see the use of meeting trouble halfway, do you, Marilla? "
"5645","1",5645,"Why can’t women be ministers, Marilla? "
"5660","1",5660,"Now, what do you think is the reason I feel like that? "
"5661","1",5661,"Do you think it’s because I’m really bad and unregenerate?”  "
"5678","1",5678,"It’s a serious thing to grow up, isn’t it, Marilla? "
"5724","1",5724,"What has come over you?”  "
"5738","1",5738,"“What has become of your story club? "
"5748","1",5748,"“Do you think you’ll be able to get through?”  "
"5773","1",5773,"“It does seem as if it was the end of everything, doesn’t it?” "
"5780","1",5780,"Oh, we have had jolly times, haven’t we, Anne? "
"5796","1",5796,"“Wouldn’t we have a perfectly elegant time? "
"5803","1",5803,"“You’ll write to me while you’re in, won’t you?”  "
"5844","1",5844,"It seems like an age since you went to town and oh, Anne, how did you get along?”  "
"5849","1",5849,"“How did the others do?”  "
"5897","1",5897,"Won’t Miss Stacy be delighted? "
"5898","1",5898,"Oh, Anne, what does it feel like to see your name at the head of a pass list like that? "
"5904","1",5904,"I let myself think _once_, ‘What if I should come out first?’ "
"5939","1",5939,"“Do you really think the organdy will be best?” "
"5955","1",5955,"“Shall I put my pearl beads on?” "
"5969","1",5969,"Am I all ready now?”  "
"5972","1",5972,"Doesn’t she look lovely?”  "
"5994","1",5994,"What are you going to recite, Anne? "
"5995","1",5995,"And are you nervous?”  "
"6001","1",6001,"“What will you recite if they encore you?”  "
"6016","1",6016,"What were her pearl beads compared to the diamonds of the big, handsome lady near her? "
"6031","1",6031,"Had she ever thought she could recite? "
"6072","1",6072,"“Hasn’t it been a perfectly splendid time?” "
"6086","1",6086,"Well, we heard him say--didn’t we, Jane?--‘Who is that girl on the platform with the splendid Titian hair? "
"6089","1",6089,"But what does Titian hair mean?”  "
"6092","1",6092,"“_Did_ you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?” "
"6095","1",6095,"Wouldn’t you just love to be rich, girls?”  "
"6101","1",6101,"Would you want to be that white-lace girl and wear a sour look all your life, as if you’d been born turning up your nose at the world? "
"6102","1",6102,"Or the pink lady, kind and nice as she is, so stout and short that you’d really no figure at all? "
"6103","1",6103,"Or even Mrs. Evans, with that sad, sad look in her eyes? "
"6209","1",6209,"Have you anything eatable around, Anne? "
"6226","1",6226,"Cake? "
"6227","1",6227,"You’ll give me a teeny piece, won’t you? "
"6245","1",6245,"“Wouldn’t Matthew be proud if I got to be a B.A.? "
"6320","1",6320,"“What are you going to wear for commencement, Jane?” "
"6350","1",6350,"Isn’t it splendid?”  "
"6359","1",6359,"“Reckon you’re glad we kept her, Marilla?” "
"6364","1",6364,"“Aren’t you proud of that Anne-girl? "
